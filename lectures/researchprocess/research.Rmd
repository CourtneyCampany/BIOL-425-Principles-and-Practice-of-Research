**BUT… the basic principles underlying both are exactly the same!**
<br/>

**There is more crossover in these disciplines than ever before**

## What is the point of doing research?
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">

* **Research allows us to:**
    + Examine ideas and explanations
    + Gather information and data
    + Find and eliminate flaws in our thinking

<br/>

* **In other words, move beyond philosophy to science**


<br/>

* **Science values empiricism over dogma**
    + empiricism = 
    + dogma = 

</div>

## Two types of reasoning used in science
<hr>

**Two kinds of reasoning (or logic) are used in scientific research:**
<br/>

1. *Inductive reasoning*: takes a specific example and induces that it can be applied to a much larger group
<br/>

2. *Deductive reasoning*: starts with a general principle & deduces that it applies to a specific case


<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:300px; LEFT:300px; WIDTH:500px; HEIGHT:400px" SRC="images/reasoning.png">

## 

**Generally…**

<br/>

* **Inductive reasoning is used in an attempt to discover a new piece of information**

<br/>

* **Deductive reasoning is used to prove that piece of information**

## Lets practive: Which type of reasoning?

<br/>

<div style="float: right; width: 70%;">

**Every day, I get in my car to leave for work, at 8:00am. The trip takes 45 minutes, and I arrive at work on time. If I leave for work at 8:00am today, I will be on time.**

<br/>

**Today, I left for work at eight o'clock and was on time. Therefore, every day that I leave the house at eight o'clock, I will arrive at work on time.**

**All dogs are mammals, and all mammals have kidneys.  Therefore, dogs must have kidneys.**

<br/>

**Hamsters, cats, humans, and platypuses have kidneys.  All of these animals are mammals.  Therefore, all mammals have kidneys.**

## The importance of model organisms
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 54%;">

**In many areas of biology, model organisms are used to gather information that can be applied more generally to other organisms**

<br/>

**Society has decided it is ethical to perform experiments on animals that benefit human society**

<br/>

**Ultimate example of *inductive reasoning*, but there are pitfalls**

## The scientific process is the method scientists use to study things
<hr>
<br/>

**Based on observation and analysis of data:**
<br/>

1. Make observations
<br/>
2. Develop a question and form a logical hypothesis
* **A hypothesis is a tentative answer to a well-framed scientific question **
<br/>
3. Test predictions arising from the hypothesis (with experiment or more observation)
<br/>
4. Analyze experimental data
<br/>
5. Revise hypothesis and repeat

<br/>
<br/>

**The scientific process is ongoing.**

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:400px; LEFT:550px; WIDTH:250px; HEIGHT:250px" SRC="images/method.png">


## A hypothesis is an explanation for an observation
<hr>

* **A hypothesis is a tentative explanation—it isn’t written in stone**

<br/>

* **Occam’s razor is the principle that the simplest explanation (i.e. having the fewest assumptions/steps) is usually correct**

<br/>

* **A hypothesis must be both testable and falsifiable**
    + a hypothesis that a ghost cast a spell on a car to make it stop working cannot be tested

<br/>

* **Hypotheses should strive to distinguish between causality and correlation**
    + Two things that are correlated are not necessarily causally linked

<br/>

* **Other factors to consider regarding causality:**
    + are there multiple causal factors?
    + Is there a direct or indirect (remote) cause?

    
## An experiment is a test of a hypothesis
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: right; width: 60%;">

* **Predictions (if this, then that…) arise out of hypotheses that can be tested by experiments**
    + Good experimental design strives to disprove a hypothesis

<br/>

* **Scientists often perform controlled experiments in which an experimental group is compared with a control group**

<br/>

* **Ideally, experimental and control groups differ in only the one factor under investigation**
    + Controls are necessary to rule out the effects of other factors that might affect results

</div>

 <IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:240px; LEFT:30px; WIDTH:400px; HEIGHT:350px" SRC="images/experiment.jpg">
 
## “Proof” in science
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: right; width: 64%;">

**Science does not prove ideas**

<br/>

**Instead, it works by rejecting hypotheses based on supporting and refuting evidence to advance understanding**

<br/>

**Findings are tentative since the REAL explanation may not have been considered**

<br/>

**Science is based on the principle that any idea, no matter how widely accepted, can be overturned if evidence warrants it**
</div>


<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:250px; LEFT:20px; WIDTH:350px; HEIGHT:300px" SRC="images/prove.jpg">

## Science is ongoing
<hr>

* **The scientific process produces results that can be used in both inductive and deductive reasoning:**
    + Allow generalization (inductive reasoning)
    + Supports or rejects a model or theory (deductive)

<br/>

* **Research always generates more questions than answers!**

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:375px; LEFT:275px; WIDTH:600px; HEIGHT:300px" SRC="images/newton.jpg">

## Practical development of research questions
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

* **The research you perform depends on many factors:**
    + Your interest
    + Your goal
    + Area of biological research
    + Research setting
    + Resources available


<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:220px; LEFT:575px; WIDTH:500px; HEIGHT:400px" SRC="images/question2.jpg">

## Different kinds of research have different goals
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">

* **Scientific research can be roughly divided into two categories with different goals**
    + *Basic research* – research about how the world works
        + Driven by curiosity
        + No obvious or immediate commercial value
    + *Applied research* – research with specific aims
        + To solve practical problems: technological / medical
        + Relies upon previous basic research

<br/>
<br/>

**Both are extremely important to drive scientific and technological advancement**

</div>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:180px; LEFT:675px; WIDTH:400px; HEIGHT:450px" SRC="images/applied.jpg">

## Examples of different research types in human health...
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**Examples of basic research: **
<br/>

1. An investigation into the symptoms of diarrhea. 
<br/>

2. An investigation into the secondary symptoms of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)

<br/>

**Examples of applied research: **
<br/>

1. An investigation to determine the healing properties of mushrooms.
<br/>

2. An investigation to determine the side effects of alcohol consumption.

## Science, technology, and society are interrelated
<hr>
<br/>

**Science and technology rely on each other to provide benefits for society**

## Research Settings (potential careers)
<hr>

**The place research is being conducted determines the kinds of questions that will be investigated**

<br/>

* **Each setting has advantages and disadvantages**
    + *Academic – small institution* (Shepherd University)
        + Great freedom, undergrad students
        + low budget, lack of equipment
    + *Academic – large research institution* (WVU)
        + Great freedom, advanced equipment, graduate students
        + constant scramble for grant money
    + *Industrial* – biotech, pharmaceutical, agriculture (Pfizer)
        + Advanced equipment, staff focused on a single task
        + Less freedom
    + *Government* (Department of Defense, USDA, NIH)
        + Some degree of freedom
        + Red tape, scramble for money
