## Study design considerations  
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">

* **Your capstone paper should mirror the scientific process, so you need to think critically about the sources and information you use**

<br/>

* **When reading primary research papers, it is important to understand and evaluate the way a study was performed:**
    + Is the question appropriate?  (i.e. testable/answerable)
    + Is the experimental approach logical?
    + What types of methods/instruments/sites were involved?
    + How were the results assessed?  What was measured?  Does it make sense to measure it? Is there a better way to measure it?

<br/>

* **The same is true if you are designing/performing research**

**How different is “different enough” between two groups to declare an effect?**

<br/>


**How many times do you need to sample something to be representative?**

## Statistics to the rescue!
<hr>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:160px; LEFT:200px; WIDTH:700px; HEIGHT:500px" SRC="images/stats2.png">

## Expectations for a scientific paper
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: right; width: 70%;">

* **Goal is to use collected observations to make the strongest possible conclusion about whether to accept a hypothesis**

<br/>

* **So…**
    + Experimental data should be quantified and analyzed appropriately
    + Large groups of data should be summarized for the reader

<br/>

* **Expectations for the use of statistics is higher in some fields of biology than in others**
    + Generally, ecological studies make greater use of statistics

</div>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:275px; LEFT:50px; WIDTH:250px; HEIGHT:250px" SRC="images/rigor.jpg">


## Descriptive Statistics
<hr>

* **Procedures that organize, summarize, or present data in an informative way**
    + describe aspects of center and spread in data

* **Central tendency = a single value that describes a dataset by identifying the central position**

* **The MEAN is the most common statistic used for this purpose**
    + Example:  the average score on an exam in a class

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:380px; LEFT:100px; WIDTH:900px; HEIGHT:300px" SRC="images/mean.png">

## Aspects of Spread: Variance
<hr>

* **The spread of distribution, or VARIANCE, around the mean is also important information**

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

* **These three data sets have the same mean but different VARIANCES**

<br/>

* **Higher variance indicates that the values in the data set are more spread out**

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:200px; LEFT:350px; WIDTH:350px; HEIGHT:300px" SRC="images/distribution.png">

## Standard deviation is a common measure of variance
<hr>
<br/>

* **Standard deviation = a measure of how far each value in the data set is from the mean**

<br/>

* **A higher standard deviation for your data set means you have a greater spread of values**


<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:330px; LEFT:300px; WIDTH:525px; HEIGHT:350px" SRC="images/distribution2.gif">
    
## Inferential statistics
<hr>
<br/>

* **Results often represent a portion of the overall population, but can be used to estimate information about the entire population with some amount of uncertainty**


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

* **The larger your sample size, the more representative it is of the entire population**
    + increasing the number of measurements increases the power of a statistical analysis
    
<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:265px; LEFT:275px; WIDTH:600px; HEIGHT:250px" SRC="images/stats.png">

## Hypothesis testing is widely used in science
<hr>

* **Hypothesis testing:**
    + Determine if there is a correlation between two variables
        + If X increases, does Y also increase? (positive)
        + If X decreases, does Y also decrease? (negative)
        
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

* **Determine if there are differences between two data sets**
    + one group receives drug, the other does not
    + number of species in one location versus another location
    + amount of cell death after treatment with a drug

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:285px; LEFT:250px; WIDTH:600px; HEIGHT:250px" SRC="images/correlation.png">

## The null hypothesis proposes no relationship
<hr>

* **A null hypothesis is a type of hypothesis used in statistics that proposes that there no relationship or difference between two parameters (e.g. two experimental groups, an independent variable and a dependent variable)—in other words, the results are due to chance alone**
    + For any experiment, there is a null hypothesis

<br/>

* **We aren’t proving things in science!  The rejection of hypotheses is how we progress in science**

<br/>

* **Statistical tests allow us to use observed data to reject a null hypothesis and accept the alternative:  that there is a relationship or difference**


<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:460px; LEFT:400px; WIDTH:275px; HEIGHT:200px" SRC="images/null.png">

## Experimental design (according to a statistician)
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

**1. Set up the null and alternative hypotheses**

<br/>

**2. Determine what type and how much data you will need to collect in your study**

<br/>

**3. Choose a statistical analysis that will allow you to accept or reject your null hypothesis at a desired confidence level**

<br/>

**4. Perform your experiment, analyze data, and draw conclusions**

</div>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:220px; LEFT:550px; WIDTH:500px; HEIGHT:400px" SRC="images/design.jpg">

## Brainstorm: What are some limits to experimental design?
<hr>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:250px; LEFT:25px; WIDTH:500px; HEIGHT:300px" SRC="images/oven.png">

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:220px; LEFT:550px; WIDTH:500px; HEIGHT:400px" SRC="images/face.jpg">

## How statistical significance is reported
<hr>

* **When you perform a statistical test, a p-value helps you determine the significance of your results in relation to the null hypothesis.**

<br/>

* **Scientific papers will always report p-values if results have been statistically analyzed**


<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:330px; LEFT:250px; WIDTH:550px; HEIGHT:350px" SRC="images/normaldist.png">

## Setting the bar for statistical significance 
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 65%;">

* **p-values range between 0 and 1 and indicate the probability that the null hypothesis is true**
    + how likely are results are due to chance alone

<br/>

* **The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis**
    + i.e. the observed difference is NOT due to chance

<br/>

* **A standard value used for significance in science is p = .05.  This means you can conclude that 95% of the time, an observed effect is NOT due to chance**

</div>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:200px; LEFT:750px; WIDTH:250px; HEIGHT:400px" SRC="images/pvalue.png">

## Important considerations for statistics
<hr>
<br/>

**Both descriptive and inferential statistics whittle down large data sets down to a few conclusions**

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

<br/>

* **Statistical conclusions are never 100% certain**
    + always a small chance that the null hypothesis provides a poor explanation of the data even when it is true.
    + always a small chance that the null hypothesis provides an explanation of the data even when it is false

<br/>

* **A significant test can be misleading if the sample size is so small that an important effect goes undetected**

</div>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:250px; LEFT:550px; WIDTH:500px; HEIGHT:400px" SRC="images/typeerrors.jpg">

## How to talk about statistics in a paper
<hr>
<br/>

* **Unless you have a compelling reason, you do not need to cite specific p values of other researchers in your paper**

<br/>

* **Be decisive in your language—if a peer-reviewed primary paper reaches a conclusion, don’t hedge, but state it as fact**
    + the reader has the citation if they want to evaluate that author's work
