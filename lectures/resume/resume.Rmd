## Making your resume as effective as possible
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

**Your goal is to clearly articulate how your skills and experiences align to the criteria defined by the job posting**

<br/>

**You should always take the time to tailor your resume to the job opportunity for which you are applying**

<br/>

**Carefully study the job listing (and related listings) to identify skills, experience, education and other qualifications the potential employer is looking to find**

<br/>

**Focus on the "requirements," "skills" or "qualifications" sections and look for buzzwords**


## Be concise
<hr>

<div style="float: left; width: 65%;">

* **Recruiters receive dozens of applications for some positions. The first step involves quickly skimming through submissions and eliminating candidates who clearly are not qualified.**

<br/>

* **A resume should typically be a single page**
    + As you gain job experiences or if you have information that is highly relevant to the position, you can expand to two pages (maximum)

<br/>

* **Look at your resume and ask:**
    + Can a hiring manager see my main credentials right away? 
    + Does critical information jump off the page? 
    + Do I effectively sell myself on the top quarter of the first page? 

</div>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:300px; LEFT:750px; WIDTH:400px; HEIGHT:225px" SRC="images/resumes.jpg">

## Education section
<hr>
<br/>

<br/>

* **Include:**
    + University name
    + Location (city, state)
    + Date of graduation (month, year)
    + Degree(s)
    + GPA (only include if your GPA is above 3.0, format: GPA: 3.5/4.0)


## Relevant work experience
<hr>
<br/>

* **This will eventually be the core of your resume, where you prove the skills you’ve listed in your qualifications summary and/or career objective.**
    + “Relevant Experience” or “Work Experience” or “Professional Experience.”
    + List only experience that is relevant to the job you are applying for.
    + List your work experiences in reverse chronological order

<br/>

* **For each position, create a heading including the company’s name, city and state, your title, and the dates of employment (month and year).**

<br/>

* **Include 1-3 bullet points that detail your main duties and achievements.**
    + A strong bullet point has:
        + 1st: Action Verb (should always be first)
        + 2nd: Quantifiable Point
        + 3rd: Specific and relevant job duty

## Relevant work experience
<hr>
<br/>

* **Use non-science work experiences to highlight important transferable skills**
    + leadership, working in teams, managing, etc.

**EXAMPLES:**
<br/>

**Trained 3 undergraduate students, taught basic microscopy skills and guided their research through the semester**

<br/>

**Conducted weekly wetland monitoring surveys, measured turtle species abundance and water quality**

<br/>

**PRO-TIP**: Find key verbs and occupation-specific nouns inside the job listing, then spread them cleverly throughout your resume


## The skills section
<hr>
<br/>

* **Listing tons of skills on your resume doesn’t actually prove you’re skilled, but it is important to highlight your relevant capabilities throughout your resume to catch the eye of a potential employer**

<br/>

* **Working various skills into the introduction and work experience sections will strengthen your candidacy.** 

<br/>

* **The skills section is where you will highlight and detail important skill that are *relevant* to the position.**
    + think about the order you present them
    + more is not always better

<br/>

* **There are two kinds of skills that can be included on a resume:  *hard* skills and *soft* skills**
