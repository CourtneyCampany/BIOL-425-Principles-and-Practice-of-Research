## First impressions and the “elevator pitch”
<hr>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">

* **Your first impression on the audience is critical to guarantee their interest**

<br/>


* **Begin your presentation with a very short synopsis with three vital bits of information:**
    + What is your research topic?
    + What have you found?
    + Why is it important?

<br/>

* **Focus on the big picture (top of the funnel)—you want to hook them with the big picture so they are then excited to hear about the small details.**
    + 3 minute thesis will help!

## Telling your story
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: right; width: 80%;">

* **After your elevator pitch, build the narrative of your research in around 5 min**
    + Like any story, it needs a beginning, middle, and end

<br/>
<br/>

* **Beginning:  set the scene and introduce the main characters**
    + Provide the necessary background information that your audience must know
    + How did this lead to your research question?
    + What were you hoping to find out and why?
    + Who are the main characters? (e.g. drug, disease, gene, cell type, technique, etc.)

</div>

## Telling your story
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 55%;">

* **Middle: the adventure…**
    + How did you get from your research question to your conclusion?
    + Why did you choose to take that route?
    + What did you find on your way?
    + Were there any interesting twists?

<br/>
<br/>

* **End: the conclusion to the story.**
    + What is the ultimate consequence of your journey?
    + What does this mean for your main characters?

## Pro Tips: Nailing your poster presentation
<hr>

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">

* **Be confident — you are the expert on this subject**
    + Try to be yourself and let your personality show through
    
    <br/>
    
* **Try not to talk too rapidly**
    + avoid too much jargon
    
<br/>

* **Make eye contact with your audience**

<br/>

* **Use poster images to help you explain things—a picture is worth a thousand words**

<br/>

* **It is a good idea to check your audience’s understanding**
    + “Have I been clear enough…?” 
    + “Should I go into more detail…?”
</div>

## Consider your audience and objectives
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: right; width: 55%;">

* **Presenting a poster is a performance, and just like any performance, practice is a major factor in success**

<br/>

* **Rehearse what you will say ahead of time OUT LOUD**
    + write down notes with the main points.  You can refer to them as you develop your presentation (not while speaking).
    + Force yourself to speak aloud even if it seems silly
    + After you feel more confident, try giving it to friends and family

</div>

## Before your presentation…
<hr>

<div style="float: left; width: 58%;">

* **Understand completely why everything is included on the poster and its implications for your project or topic**

<br/>

* **Memorize your “elevator pitch”**

<br/>

* **Know your key points without referring to written notes**

<br/>

* **Be ready to answer likely questions with confidence**
    + think about what questions ahead of time
    + take note of what people ask when you rehearse
    
<br/>

* **Know how to deal with difficult questions that you might not be able to answer fully**
    + it is 'OK' to say you do not know
    + expect someone will ask that ? you can't answer
