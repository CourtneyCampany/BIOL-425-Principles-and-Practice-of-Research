## Too many words
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 68%;">

* **Our thoughts can be disorganized and tangled up. Particularly when worried about tackling an important assignment like the capstone paper**

<br/>

* **This will inevitably lead to disorganized writing**

    
<br/>

* **This disorganization almost always causes us to use too many words to say things**

* **One of the best ways to make your writing easier on readers is to eliminate complicated words**

<br/>

* **While many people utilize big words to sound more sophisticated, you should use more common synonyms if they exist. **

## Active voice vs. passive voice
<hr>
<br/>

* **In a sentence written in the active voice, the subject of sentence performs the action:**

<br/>

**The candidate believes that Congress must place a ceiling on the budget.**
<br/>
<span  style="color:green">12 words = :) </span> 

<br/>

* **In a sentence written in the passive voice, the subject receives the action:**

<br/>

**It is believed by the candidate that a ceiling must be placed on the budget by Congress.**
<br/>
<span  style="color:red">17 words = :( </span> 

## Active voice vs. passive voice
<hr>
<br/>

* **Sentences in the passive voice tend to:**
    + Use more words 
    + Cause a tangle of prepositional phrases (subject often buried next to ‘by’)
    + Confuse the reader by making things more complicated than necessary
    
<br/>

<span  style="color:red">Passive:</span> **It has been demonstrated by researchers that heart attacks can be caused by high stress.**
<br/>
<span  style="color:green">Active:</span> **Researchers have demonstrated that high stress can cause heart attacks.**

<span  style="color:red">Passive:</span> **The man was bitten by the dog.**
<br/>
<span  style="color:green">Active:</span> **The dog bit the man.**

## Converting sentences to active voice
<hr>
<br/>

<span style="color:red">Passive:</span> **It has been demonstrated by researchers that heart attacks can be caused by high stress.**
<br/>

<span style="color:green">Active:</span> **Researchers have demonstrated that high stress can cause heart attacks.**

<br/>
<br/>

* **Some tips and strategies for converting sentences from the passive to the active voice:**
    + Look for a “by” phrase (e.g., “by the dog” in the previous slide). If you find one, the sentence may be in the passive voice
    + Rewrite the sentence so that a subject buried in the “by” clause is closer to the sentence beginning
    + If the subject of the sentence is not clear, see if you can use a general term, such as “researchers,” or “the study,” or “experts in this field.”
    + This sentence ‘flipping’ puts the subject first and often removes
unnecessary words

## More Pro Tips for active voice
<hr>
<br/>

* **Swap ‘ing’ for ‘ed’. Words ending in ‘ing’ tend to be more passive than ‘ed’**

<br/>

* **Go easy on the adverbs. Although it may be more descriptive, too many adverbs slow down your writing and interrupts the flow.**
    + If your verb isn’t strong enough (meaning you need to add adverbs), consider changing it.
    
<br/>

* **Don’t be afraid to add the ‘person’ into your writing. Science writing is changing! It is now more accepted to write in the first person (e.g., we found…, our results show…).**
    + Using the first person humanizes your work and makes it more enjoyable to read for a broader audience. 

## Pro Tips: Write with the reader in mind
<hr>
<br/>

* **Readers do not simply read; they interpret. Any piece of writing, no matter how short, may mean different things to different readers. Choose your words carefully and make sure your writing is suitable for a broad audience**
    + beginner,intermediate and advanced scientist in the field
 
<br/>
 
* **Avoid statements like “obviously” or “as everyone knows” at the beginning of sentences.**
    + The purpose of science writing is not to establish your intellectual superiority.
    
<br/>

* **Never make the reader assume. Be extremely careful with use of pronouns like “it’ or ‘they” in your sentences.**
    + You are probably referring to something specific from the previous sentence. However, you could be referring to a certain part of the sentence or something else in the paragraph. 
    + In science writing, we spell it out for reader…every single time.
    + Never start a sentence with 'It'.
