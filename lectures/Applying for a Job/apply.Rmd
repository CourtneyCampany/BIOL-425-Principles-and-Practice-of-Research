## Be proactive throughout the search
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">

* **You will not find a job by sitting on the computer wishing for the perfect job to come along**

<br/>

* **Jobs don’t come along—you have to find and get them**

<br/>
<br/>

* **Make an action plan and set goals for yourself**

<br/>

* **Assertive (but not annoying) applicants are more likely to stand out from the pack**

## Prepare your job tools
<hr>

<div style="float: left; width: 70%;">

* **Job applications require the same basic set of components:**
    + *Up-to-date resume or CV*: a summary of your employment history, skills, and achievements
    + *Cover letter*: a letter sent in with your other application materials declaring your interest in the job
    + *Reference List*: contacts who can provide potential employers with an assessment of you as an employee (often previous supervisors)
    + *Transcript*: some positions may be required to confirm your education
    + *Licensure*: documentation of special training or endorsement

<br/>

* **Cover letters can be recycled but need to be tailored to each position**
    + easy to forget (Dr. C forgot many times)

<br/>

* **Social media checks may occur!**
