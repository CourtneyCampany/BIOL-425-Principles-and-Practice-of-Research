## New age of open science
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: right; width: 60%;">

* **"Open Science" = umbrella term encompassing everything related to reproducible, transparent science.**
    + *reproducible science* = 
    
<br/>

* **Movement to make all scientific data, methods, and materials accessible to all levels of society**

<br/>

* **Appeals to every area of science, from life sciences to computational sciences to theoretical sciences.**

</div>


<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:200px; LEFT:25px; WIDTH:400px; HEIGHT:400px" SRC="images/umbrella.jpg">

## Why is 'Open Science' a good thing?
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 65%;">

* **The vast majority of research is publicly funded**
    + logical that the public have access to it!
    
<br/>

* **Open and transparent research makes peer review and replication much easier**


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

* **There is evidence that Open Science gives projects more downstream impact in the scientific community**
    + *question* - how would this concept work with cancer research?

</div>

## Major themes that comprise 'Open Science' guidelines
<hr>
<br/>

**Open data: all data used in the project should be made available.**

<br/>

**Open source: all code written in the project should be publicly available.**

<br/>

**Open methods: the exact procedure of the project is publicly documented.**

<br/>

**Open review: correspondence between reviewers and authors is public.**

<br/>

**Open access: resulting publications are publicly available.**

<br/>

**Open education: all education materials are publicly available**

## Open data is the core of 'Open Science'
<hr>
<br/>

* **Publish all of the data used in your study and experiments online.**

<br/>

* **Definite shift from prior precedent**
    + most raw data from scientific experiments not available

<br/>

* **Many repositories and online data banks now exist**
    + authors still given credit (DOI)
    + Many research institutions/companies host their own open data repositories

<br/>

* **Amazon has released its own set of large public datasets:**
    + https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/
