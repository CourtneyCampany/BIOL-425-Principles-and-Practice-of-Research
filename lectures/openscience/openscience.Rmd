## New age of open science
<hr>

* **"Open Science" is something of an umbrella term encompassing everything related to reproducible, transparent science.**

<br/>

* **meant to appeal to every area of science, from life sciences to computational sciences to theoretical sciences.**

<br/>

* **movement to make all scientific data, methods, and materials accessible to all levels of society**


<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:141px; LEFT:750px; WIDTH:200px; HEIGHT:200px" SRC="images/open.jpg">

## Why is 'Open Science' a good thing?
<hr>

* **The vast majority of research is publicly funded**
    + logical that the public have access to it!
    
<br/>

* **Open and transparent research makes peer review and replication much easier**

<br/>

* **There is some convincing evidence that Open Science gives projects more downstream impact in the scientific community**

## Major themes that comprise 'Open Science' guidelines
<hr>

**Open data: all data used in the project should be made available.**
<br/>

**Open source: all code written in the project should be publicly available.**
<br/>

**Open methods: the exact procedure of the project is publicly documented.**
<br/>

**Open review: correspondence between reviewers and authors is public.**
<br/>

**Open access: resulting publications are publicly available.**
<br/>

**Open education: all education materials are publicly available**

## Open data is the core of 'Open Science'

* **All of the data used in your study and experiments are published online.**

<br/>

* **This is definitely a shift from prior precedent; most raw data from scientific experiments remain cloistered.**

<br/>

* **Repositories and online data banks have sprung up around this idea. Many research institutions host their own open data repositories, as do some large tech companies.**

<br/>

* **Amazon has released its own set of large public datasets:**
    + https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/
    
## Can you use these data for your capstone: YES
<hr>

## National Ecological Observation Network (NEON)
<hr>
<br/>

* **Offers expert ecological data from sites across the continent to power the most important science being done today** 

<br />

* **NEON is a network of field research sites, designed by ecologists to provide open data for all**
    + 81 field sites across the U.S.
    + fully operational in 2019
    
<br />

* **NEON monitors ecosystems across the United States**
    + freshwater = streams, rivers and lakes
    + terrestrial = deserts &rarr; tropical forests
    
<br />    

* **Data is free to use!!

## https://www.neonscience.org/data
<hr>
**NEON takes millions of measurements and collects thousands of samples every year**

## Lots of medical and public health databases
<hr>
<br />


* **Center of Disease Control**
    + public health data

<br />

* **1000 Genomes project**

<br />

* **Data.gov**

<br />

* **World Health Organization (WHO)

* **SEER

## CDC Wonder
<hr>
<br />

* **An integrated information and communication system for public health by the CDC**
    + promote information-driven decision making by placing timely, useful facts in the hands of public health practitioners and researchers, and
    + To provide the general public with access to specific and detailed information from CDC.
    
 <br />
 
**Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research**

<br />

**Access to a wide array of public health information.**

## 1000 Genomes Project
<hr>
<br/>

* **established the most detailed catalogue of human genetic variation**

<br/>

* **Sequenced more than 2500 individuals from 26 different populations around the world**

<br/>

* **Produced an integrated set of phased haplotypes with more than 80 million variants for these individuals**

<div style="float: left; width: 68%;">

* **A systematic review of a focused topic in the literature that provides a quantitative estimate for the effect of an experimental treatment**
    + Used to examine a specific issue to determine whether a conclusion can be reached regarding the effect of a treatment or exposure
    + Often used to address controversial issues in medicine
    + Used to understand global patterns in ecology

<hr>

* **Papers will be reviewed as drafts being submitted for peer review at a journal (i.e. not rough drafts).**
    + However, the paper is the work of the student and not a professional

<br/>

* **Papers must contain every sections appropriate to that type of paper.**

<br/>

* **The text will be reviewed for scientific content.  The paper should be written with sufficient detail that a reviewer can understand the project's rationale and conclusions without being an expert in the field.**

<br/>

* **The text will be evaluated for quality of writing, including sentence structure, word usage, grammar spelling, and other writing mechanics.**

<br/>

* **Papers will also be reviewed for technical elements such as appropriate use of references and citations, figure legends, reference citations, and appropriate figure legends.**
