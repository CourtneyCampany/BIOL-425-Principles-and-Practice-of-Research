## The capstone project
<hr>

* **You will choose a biological topic of interest to you and prepare a semester-long research project consisting of:**
    + A research paper
    + A scientific poster and presentation

<br/>

* **This is not a book report:  An important aspect of the project is its novelty—your goal is to synthesize information around a topic and draw conclusions about a hypothesis or question**
    + you must address a scientific question

<br/>

* **Your capstone project will be prepared as:**
    + a data-driven scientific paper using original research, OR 
    + a literature ‘meta-analysis’ (i.e., use some form of statistical analysis)

<br/>

* **Various aspects of both parts will be evaluated and critiqued by me, other biology faculty members, and your classmates**

## How will the capstone paper be evaluated?
<hr>

* **You will submit the paper in steps over the semester:**
    + Topic declaration
    + Rough outline with references
    + Expanded outline
    + Rough draft
    + Final paper

<br/>

* **These will be reviewed by me and feedback given**

<br/>

* **The rough draft of the paper will be critiqued by another biology faculty member and a classmate**

<br/>

* **The final draft of your capstone paper will be graded by me**
    + rubric on Brightspace**

<br/>

* **Also submitted in steps:**
    + Rough draft (peer-reviewed in a workshop)
    + Final version
    + Poster presentation to class

<br/>

* **You will present your poster in the final workshop class of the semester**

## A word about plagiarism…
<hr>

**We will devote at least one entire class to plagiarism—what it is and how to avoid it**


<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 68%;">

* **Everything submitted in this course should be in your own words—it will be checked using multiple methods**
    + utilize writing sessions to avoid plagiarism
    + utilize the writing center to avoid plagiarism
    + utilize peers to avoid plagiarism

<br/>

* **Findings are tentative since the REAL explanation may not have been considered**

<br/>

* **Ignorance is not an excuse—it doesn’t matter if you plagiarize accidentally or intentionally!**
    + Talk to me if you are unsure.
