## Professional Science Communication
<hr>
<br/>

**Brainstorm: Why do scientists communicate with each other?**

## Professional Science Communication
<hr>
<br/>

**Why do scientists communicate with each other?**

<br/>

**Because science is social**

<br/>

**Because scientists depend on each other for ideas and information**

<br/>

**Because the first requirement of a successful scientist is that s/he succeeds in persuading other scientists that s/he is a successful knowledge producer**

<br/>

**Because scientists are professional critics of their colleagues’ work**

<br/>

**Because the peer reviewed research paper is the official record of scientific achievement**

## Popular Science Communication

## Why scientists should communnicate science...
<hr>
<div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
* **Communicating science effectively needs more than facts**

<br/>

* **Fake news seems to be a new phenomenon, but fake science news is not new**
    + especially relevant in medical biology

<br/>

* **Alternative facts have plagued science for decades**

</div>

<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 95%;">


“My friends told me I shouldn’t take these toxic drugs — I should use natural medicine instead.”
<br/>

“We were going to save up to buy a water alkaliniser. Could we alkalinise the water she’s given in hospital?”
<br/>

“What if I just take turmeric instead? My son said it’s as good as the drugs.”

</div>

## Why this should matter to you, as a next gen scientist...
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:180px; LEFT:20px; WIDTH:500px; HEIGHT:500px" SRC="images/cancer.png">

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">

**Patients with cancer who rejected conventional anticancer treatments (surgery, hormone therapy, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) in favor of alternative medicine were two-and-a-half times less likely to be alive after five years.**

</div>

## Lets discuss...
<hr>
<br/>

* **The appeal of alternative medicine is well recognized**
    + are they empty promises behind friendly faces?

<br/>

* **Some complementary treatments (meditation/acupunture) to produce clinical benefits**
    + should anyone ever reject proven treatments?

<br/>

* **Who is at fault?**
    + Should we be scrutinizing alternative facts or has science been poorly communicated?

<br/>

* **Who do you think is most vulnerable to alternative science facts?**
    + Why?

## The role of education and media in altertive science facts
<hr>
<br/>

* **In the same cancer study, those with higher levels of education were more likely to reject conventional treatment!!!!**
    + suggests that those who should be able to weigh evidence, dont do it
    
<br/>

* **Younger people are more likely to choose alternative treatments**
    + 90% of 18-24 yr old engage with social media for health info
    + social media often the primary information source

<br/>

* **The role of social media in promoting or enforcing behaviors can lead to alternative facts based beliefs which are hard to shift**
    + homophily

## Implications for the health industry
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:180px; LEFT:20px; WIDTH:550px; HEIGHT:450px" SRC="images/socialmediahealth.png">

<div style="float: right; width: 45%;">
* **Business strategies that include social media can help health industry companies to take a more active, engaged role in managing individuals’ health. **

<br/>

* **Organizations should coordinate integrate information from the social media space and connect with their customers in more meaningful ways that provide value and increase trust.**
    + better positioned to meet needs of consumers

</div>

## Why is science communication so relevant...
<hr>

<div style="float: left; width: 65%;">
* **Professional science communicators are important in keeping science in the public eye**

<br/>

* **Scientists have the responsibility and the privilege to be science communicators in our daily lives, to our friends, family and neighbors**

<br/>

* **In the modern age of communication, scientist mush understand where people are coming from**
    + enthusiastic about wonder cures
    + scared for their children
    + anxious about the future

<br/>

* **We share the same feelings, but as scientists we have a different relationship with evidence**

<br/>

* **Why is there such a disconnect?**

</div>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:265px; LEFT:705px; WIDTH:400px; HEIGHT:300px" SRC="images/comm2.jpg">

## Fact-based approach to Sci Comm can be off-putting
<hr>
<br/>
<br/>

<div style="float: left; width: 65%;">

**Scientists need to be great at communicating on 2 different levels**
<br/>

**1. Communicating our research effectively to other scientists**
<br/>

**2. Effective in making our science accessible to all**

<br/>

* **Every scientists should be able to communicate the 'hook' of their research**
    + why it matters to anyone off the street
    + we will practice this with the 3MT
    + makes you a better scientist!
</div>

## The path for effective popular science communication is muddy
<hr>
<br/>

* **Public skepticism regarding science covers many domains**

<br/>
<br/>

* **Political ideology interacts with climate change skepticism **

<br/>

* **Religious ideology interacts with vaccine skepticism**
    + also with science funding
    
<br/>

* **Level of education interacts with skepticism about genetic modifications**

</div>


## Major arguments for promoting popular Sci Comm
<hr>
<br/>

* **Pipeline Argument:** continued health of science depends on each generation of scientists enthusing the best and brightest of the next generation to become scientists

<br/>

* **Explore this topic in the 'professional' or 'popular' sense (or both)**

<br/>

* **Prepare a 2-minute oral presentation, for a smart but uninformed, non-specialist audience**
