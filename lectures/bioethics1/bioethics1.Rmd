## Ethics: The basics
<hr>

* **Ethics is a field of study that looks at the moral basis of human behavior…  

Why do we act as we do?

* **…and attempts to determine the best course of action in the face of conflicting choices…and provides reasons why.**

How do we decide what to do when people disagree about a complex issue?

## Bioethics
<hr>

* **The subfield of ethics applied to the life sciences**

* **Scientific breakthroughs and new biomedical technologies have brought great benefits to society, but they also raise difficult questions about when and how they should be used.  **

* **Helps us, as a society, make decisions about:**
    * How best to use new scientific knowledge
    * How to make policy decisions regarding medicines or therapies
    * How we should behave toward each other

* **YOU will face ethical questions that your parents and grandparents never had to contend with**

## What is an ethical question?

* **Often involve words like “should” or “ought” implying that a difficult decision must be made.**

* **There are several alternate solutions, none of which are without some problematic or challenging aspect**

* **Contain conflicting moral choices and dilemmas, and the underlying values of the people involved may clash**

* **They have no right or wrong answer which satisfies all parties, but better or worse answers based on well-reasoned justifications**

* **Ethical questions can be distinguished from questions about personal preference, legal, and scientific questions**

## Ethical, legal, scientific, or personal preference?  
<hr>

Which sport is the most exciting?
Whom should you marry?
How are embryonic stem cells different from adult stem cells?
Should embryonic stem cells be used in biomedical research?
Can scientists patent genes?
Should people be allowed to patent genes?
Should you lie to protect the safety of your family?
Do you need to credit another scientist who worked with you on your paper?

## Case Study: The Trolley Problem
<hr>

There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:

A. Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.
B. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

**Lets have a secret vote.....**

## Opinion vs Ethics: The Trolley Problem
<hr>

* **You probably had a “gut” feeling about the trolley problem…you may not even be able to explain why you came to the decision**

* **This is where ethics comes in!**

* **Ethics is not a matter of opinion. An important part of ethical thought is to provide a justification for a course of action—successful arguments are well-reasoned**

    * For example, think about making judgements about vaccines.  You need to know about the risks of getting a disease, the magnitude of harm that could occur if the disease is contracted, the risk of suffering that harm, as well as efficacy and side effects of a vaccine.

    * Ethical decisions are often made with incomplete information!

* **Not treating an individual as a means to an end or goal**

* **Often involves not interfering with a person’s ability to make and carry out decisions**

2. Maximize benefits while minimizing harms

3. Justice or fairness

Sometimes these ethical considerations will point out the best way to act, while at other times they conflict and cannot all be satisfied

Sometimes it is not easy or even possible to act in accordance with all relevant considerations

Each individual prioritizes and chooses which considerations should be favored in their own way (influenced by experience, culture, religion, etc.)

Often, there is no one right answer!
