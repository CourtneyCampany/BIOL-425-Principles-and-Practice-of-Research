## Case Study: The Trolley Problem
<hr>
<br/>

**There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track. You have two options:**

<br/>

**A. Do nothing and allow the trolley to kill the five people on the main track.**
<br/>
**B. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one  person.**

**Lets have a secret vote.....**

## Opinion vs Ethics: The Trolley Problem
<hr>

* **You probably had a “gut” feeling about the trolley problem…you may not even be able to explain why you came to the decision**
  
<br/>

* **This is where ethics comes in!**

<br/>

* **Is ethics is not a matter of opinion? An important part of ethical thought is to provide a justification for a course of action—successful arguments are well-reasoned**

## Ethical decisions: Key questions to ask yourself
<hr>

<br/>

* **What are the relevant facts necessary to think carefully about it?**
    * Particularly important for bioethics
